About DroneKit
DroneKit-Python allows developers to create apps that run on an onboard companion computer and communicate with the ArduPilot flight controller using a low-latency link. Onboard apps can significantly enhance the autopilot, adding greater intelligence to vehicle behaviour, and performing tasks that are computationally intensive or time-sensitive (for example, computer vision, path planning, or 3D modelling). DroneKit-Python can also be used for ground station apps, communicating with vehicles over a higher latency RF-link.

The API communicates with vehicles over MAVLink. It provides programmatic access to a connected vehicleâ€™s telemetry, state and parameter information, and enables both mission management and direct control over vehicle movement and operations
